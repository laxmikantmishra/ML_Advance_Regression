## General Information
# Machine learning advance regression
## Surprise Housing (Australia Business Expansion) Case Study

#### Problem Statement:

A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price.

Essentially, What company wants â€”

The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market. You are required to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not

#### Approach:

- Build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not..

- To know the accuracy of the model, i.e. To predict to decide whether to invest in them or not.
